# Fizz Buzz

#### Requirements:
Make a program that counts to 100 using the below substitutions.:

 1. Any number that is a multiple of 3 replace with "fizz" instead
 2. Any number that is a multiple of 5 replace with "buzz" instead
 3. Any number is that a multiple of both 3 and 5 replace with "fizzbuzz"



#### How I Made This Work:
I used a for loop to create an array of integers 1 through 100. 
Then, I created a function called divisibles with an if/else if statement that uses the splice method to replace any divisibles with the words required above.
